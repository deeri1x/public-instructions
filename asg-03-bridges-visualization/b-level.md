### The Path of the B That Leads to the A-

This path is for those who have a bit more time than for the C and who are looking for a better mark as a payoff.

At this level, you will need to do the same thing as for the C, plus one more thing:

- color the nodes of the linked list based on some characteristic of the data inside the node. For example, if your nodes contained tweet data from WallStreetBets, you could color nodes that contain profane words red....or different shades of red, depending on how many such words there are.

There are tutorials on the BRIDGES site showing how to color nodes. It's not terribly difficult! 

**I estimate it'll take about an extra hour over the C level to add this extra feature.**

### Completed Example

Here's an example of the result from a completed B level project. I chose beer data from Kaggle and colored according to the abv (alcohol by volume) field - red nodes have a high abv, yellow ones a medium, and green low:
