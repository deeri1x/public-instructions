### The Path of the A-

This path is for those who have a bit more time than for the B+ and who are looking for a better mark as a payoff.

At this level, you will need to do the same thing as for the B, plus one more thing:

- add code that will color the path taken in a linear search for an item in your list. You have to generate two visualizations:
    1. one that shows the path for a search that finds the item being searched for, and
    2. one that shows the path for a search that fails to find the item
  

**I estimate it'll take about an extra hour over the B+ level to add this extra feature.**

### Completed Example

Here's an example of the result from a completed A- level project. I used the same project as the B+ level, but then did two linear searches (starting at the head and travelling until I found my target or went through the whole list), coloring the links travelled in thick orange lines.

Here's the result of the first search (for a beer with an IBU > 100):

Here's a search that's guaranteed to fail: for beers with an IBU > 200!
