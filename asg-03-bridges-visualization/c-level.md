### The Path of the C That Leads to the B

This path is for those who are short on time and just want something simple to do at the end of the semester and are willing to take an average mark in exchange.

At this level, you will need to do these 2 things:

1. create a generic singly or doubly-linked list using the BRIDGES API,
2. create a *very* simple client that populates an instance of your list with **at least** 500 items from a CSV you find on Kaggle

If this sounds difficult, here are some things to reassure you that it's not:

- you've already created code for both singly-linked and doubly-linked lists in the drills and assignment one, so your first task is basically completed already - you *will* have to make some **minor** adjustments, but we're talking maybe 15 minutes of find-and-replace
- bringing things in from a CSV file is a solved problem and you can find many easy-to-implement solutions online with little effort. I'm fine with you using these as a foundation for your solution, just do the right thing and site them.


**I estimate the time required to finish this level to be in the 2-to-3 hour range, assuming you have completed drills involving linked lists and/or assignment one.**


### Completed Example

Here's an example of the result from a completed C level project. I chose beer data from Kaggle. Each dot is a Beer object with info about that beer:

That's purdy cool.
