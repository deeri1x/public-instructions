### Grade: C range

- all requirements from [the path of the C](c-level.md).

### Grade: B range

- all requirements from [the path of the B](b-level.md).

### Grade: A-

- all requirements from [the path of the A-](a-minus-level.md).

### Grade: A+

## DESIGN GUIDELINES

If you want to know what I'm looking for, see my [design guidelines](design-guidelines.md).

Solutions that are a design hot mess will trend downward mark-wise, even if the requirements for that level have technically been met.

I also expect few Checkstyle and no PMD warnings; if there are a lot of warnings present, that'll trend you downward as well.
