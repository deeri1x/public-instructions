# A-Level & B-Level Details

Since we're closer to the finish line, I thought I'd provide some clarifications of things happening at the A and B levels.


## Code Introductions

I was originally calling these "presentations" - but that might not be the right word. I'd like you to take 10-15 minutes to show me what you have completed. Introduce me to your code. I'll ask some questions. It's not meant to be a high-pressure experience.
 
**You don't have to be finished your assignment at the time of the Introduction**. Feel free to continue working on your assignment after the Intro and just submit your final work before the deadline.


## The Process

1. Find 15 minutes between Mar 29 (M) and Apr 01 (R) where you (and your partner, if you paired up) can meet with me - you know where my schedule is! You can choose a time during your tutorial on Apr 01 as well, as I'm using that tutorial for Intros. 
  
    > _I'd suggest having a backup time (or two), just in case the slot you want doesn't work out on my end._
    
    
2. Contact me with your suggested meeting time(s). I'll send you a Google Calendar invite for the time that works for us both.
3. **Before our meeting**, you have to push your work to GitHub so that I have something to look at as you're introducing me to your code.  
4. At the appointed time, we'll get together on Meet and have a low-key look at your code.


## What if you're _kinda_ done a level?

Look: if you're _reasonably close_ to completing an A or B level, I'm more than happy to give you a mark at the lower end of that level (i.e. an A- or B- ). So please don't hesitate to submit a partially-working solution at that level.

My only request is that you submit something that compiles - I need to have something that I can at least _run_, even if it blows up. 

## If you're planning on going for the A

You might be wondering if you need to have a B solution done as well. 

The answer is "no" - assuming you've got even a partially-working A-level solution done, you will have demonstrated that you are able to use your TreeMap to find results of pulls. 

## Do I _have_ to do an Introduction? Can't I just submit the assignment?

I'd like to touch base, so if you want to get an A or B, please meet with me.
