# ASG-02 : The Potion Explosion Move Mom

## _(aka Listen To Your Mother)_

**GitHub Link**: https://classroom.github.com/a/_xWqW-Mb

**DUE:** Apr 10 (Sa) by end of the day (a.k.a. 11:59PM or whenever JP gets up)

**Late Policy:** no lates; I've gotta mark this and asg-03, too!

**Submissions:** just like with drills

## BUGS/CHANGES

You can find info of current bugs (with fixes) and other changes at the [bug/change list](bug-change-list.md) for this assignment.

## Preamble

This assignment _kinda_ continues with the first assignment...but before you start swearing or breaking things or curling up into a fetal ball, hear me out.

Here are some Good Things to Calm You Down:

- you don't have to figure out how to do explosions - you've got a working EIPQ provided for you (though if you're attached to the one you built for the last assignment, you can use that one)
- you have more freedom to design your own stuff, which might be fun. Or paralyzing. Or paralyzingly fun.
- the end result is actually usable...though ethically questionable. Which is intriguing in and of itself, don't you think?

### The Goal

To create a brute-force Potion Explosion Move Mom (PEMM).

At the A-level, you give PEMM a dispenser configuration, along with the potions you have and your current ingredient pool contents...and she'll choose the "best" move(s) to make based on a strategy that you design.

I think this sounds cool. I hope you think so, too!

## Skills Covered

In this assignment, you will need to:

- [ ] make a binary search tree.
- [ ] create a map from your BST.
- [ ] implement an Iterator<E>.
- [ ] design and implement a non-trivial application using trees.
- [ ] design and code recursive algorithms over trees.

Finally, you will find this assignment requires:

- effective use of your editor, including the debugger.
- the ability to take a large task and work on it gradually over a period of time. Attempts to do this assignment at the last minute will fail.
- careful reading of these instructions and the documentation present in the starting code.


## So What Am I Supposed to DO, Man?!?

Here are my suggestions. These are not the only way to get this assignment done successfully. I still think they work pretty well, though:

1. First, skim through these instructions. Just like in the first assignment. 
1. Next, watch [this video](https://youtu.be/8oUPc_GZAJ0) demoing a working B-level version of this assignment and also [this video](https://youtu.be/9gIEfElbiAs) demoing a working A-level version. That way, you'll have a clear picture in your mind what your A and B level destinations are.
1. Take a look at [the rubric](rubric.md) so you know how marks are assigned. Notice how the rubric forces you to progress through the different test levels, from F+ all the way up to A+, just like in the first assignment.
1. (Optional) If you're working on a team, you might want to start openly talking about such things as:
   1. what grade are you shooting for? Be honest and open with yourselves - not everyone's shooting for the A...and that's fine.
   2. how will you divvy up the work?
   3. what's your pace? 
   4. how will your team share code?
1. (Optional) If you're shooting for an A, then since you want to evaluate different possible moves, you're going to need to know the rules. I'm assuming you had already read through them for the first assignment, but if not, you'll want to do so for this one.
1. Finally, get to work! Start at the F+ level requirements in the overview section that follows, fulfill them, and keep moving up the grade scales!

## Overviews of Each Level

> _Note:_  
> _You don't have to concern yourselves with PMD/Checkstyle issues until you get to the B level and above._

1. [F+ level](f-plus-level.md)
1. [D Level](d-level.md)
1. [D+ Level](d-plus-level.md)
1. [C- Level](c-minus-level.md)
1. [C Level](c-level.md)
1. [C+ Level](c-plus-level.md)

> Once you get past the C's, if you want to get into the B's or A's, you will have to **demonstrate** your working application to JP. This will require that you arrange to have a brief (10-15 minute) Google Meet to do the demonstration.

Further details about these demos (which I've now re-branded as "introductions"), and other things A and B related, can be found at [a-and-b-level-details](a-and-b-level-details.md)

> Also at this level, if you don't like the code that's been provided to you by JP - change it! No hard feelings! (I've made some questionable choices - some on purpose, some not - and you're free to address them if you wish, or live with them if you don't).

2. [A Level](a-level.md)

**YOU SHOULD PUSH YOUR WORK TO GITHUB AFTER YOU COMPLETE EVERY LEVEL - THAT WAY, YOU'LL HAVE BACKUPS OF YOUR WORK!!!**

## Additional Perks Available

If you're in need of some Perks, there are [opportunities in this assignment](perk-opportunities.md), just like there were in the last one.
